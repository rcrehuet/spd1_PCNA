 This is a single-CPU calculation (no parallelism of any kind).

 **MONTE CARLO CUTOFF SETTINGS:
 Short-range cutoff is applied at inter-residue resolution.
 Residue-based cutoff (IPP/LJ) :             12.000
 Residue-based cutoff (EL/TAB) :             12.000
 Computing all monopole-monopole terms beyond (EL/TAB) cutoff in minimum image convention at reduced resolution (point approximation). This applies to all residue pairs, for which both are flagged as carrying a net charge.
 SR/bias MC screen (kcal/mol)  :        1000.00    


 Polymers are built with all hydrogen atoms (All-Atom Model).

 14-Interactions included in energy calculation.

 Modified NB model used (all atoms separated by rigid or quasi-rigid bonds only are excluded from NB energy evaluations).
 Fudge factors for 14-interactions are assigned whenever exactly three bonds (the middle one rotatable) separate two atoms.

 Reduced (sane) group-based electrostatic model used (only full charge groups interact (fully, fully fudged or not at all) as determined by automatic charge group finder).

 Polymer chains (if any) are linear and non-cyclic.

 The system geometry for the first      4 molecule(s) was read from PDB-file (see above).
 A total of    7057 atoms was missing in these molecules, which were built in default covalent geometries.
 Any missing molecules were left in default conformations (extended for polymers) and then placed randomly (inevitable).
 All randomizations of completely missing molecules used a hierarchical Monte Carlo procedure based on excluded volume, torsional, and boundary interactions (if any).
 En. threshold (kcal/mol) per res. pair:             50.000
 Max. att. per unit (mol./loop/res.)   :        300
