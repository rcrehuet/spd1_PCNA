# spd1_PCNA
This repository contains the simulation setup files for the simulation of the spd1 intrinsically disordered protein complexed with PCNA (trimer).

spd1 one can bind PCNA through two different binding motifs, called PIP-box and PIP-degron.

The simulations are Replica Exchange Monte Carlo simulations run with CAMPARI. For more setup details and the biophysical interpretation, see the publication related to this work: _Pending submission link_
